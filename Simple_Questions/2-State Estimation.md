# Kalman Filter
- What do you know about Kalman Filters? Describe how it can be used in vehicle localization with a block diagram showing the estimation loop.
Its an algorithm used to estimate the state of a dynamic system from noisy sensor measurements. It operates by predicting the current state and updating it based on new measurements to minimize uncertainty.
[ Previous State ] --> [ Predict State ] --> [ Update State ] --> [ New State ]
                               |                        ^
                               |                        |
                     [ Control Input ]         [ Sensor Data ]


- Imagine you're working on a self-driving car project and need to localize a vehicle in an unknown environment using a Kalman filter.  
For localizing a self-driving car, the states to estimate include position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), orientation (yaw), and possibly acceleration. Sensorswould be
GPS: For position.
IMU: For acceleration and angular velocity.
LiDAR/Camera: For detecting obstacles and environmental features.

# SLAM
- Explain the concept of SLAM, mentioning different types of it.
Its the process of building a map of an unknown environment while also keeping track of the vehicle’s location within that map. There are two main types:
Visual SLAM: Uses cameras for mapping and localization.
LiDAR-based SLAM: Uses LiDAR to build high-precision maps and localize the vehicle.

- How can we build a map in SLAM? What type of sensors might be useful for doing this task?
SLAM builds a map by using sensor data to detect landmarks or environmental features, which are used to update the map as the vehicle moves. Useful sensors include:
LiDAR: Generates detailed 3D point clouds.
Cameras: Capture visual features and textures.
IMU: Provides motion data.

- How does SLAM perform vehicle localization in an unknown environment? Discuss in two different types of SLAM.
Visual SLAM: The system uses features detected in camera images to track the vehicle’s movement relative to the environment.
LiDAR SLAM: In this case, the system relies on the dense point clouds generated by LiDAR to localize the vehicle by matching the current scan to the map created so far.
